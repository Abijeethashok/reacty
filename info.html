            <h2>DECRATIVE</h2>
            <p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application and react will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.</p>
         <h2>COMPONENT BASED</h2>
         <p> Build encapsulated that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

          Since component logic is written in javascript</p>

          <h2>LEARN ONCE, WRITE ANY TIME</h2>
        <P>we don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in react without rewriting existing code.

          react can render on  server.</P>
